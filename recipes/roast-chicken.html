      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This is a recipe about a super simple roast chicken.</p>
      <p>For the amount of ingredients, honestly I was impressed.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <uo>
            <li>1 large head (2 1/2 pounds) green cabbage</li>
            <li>Splash of oil, any kind</li>
            <li>kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 whole chicken (shown here is 3 pounds)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>A lemon, if you wish, for serving (we never used ours)</li>
        </uo>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat your oven to 450 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Halve your cabbage and slice each half into 1 to 1.5 inch thick slabs.</li>
            <li>Very thinly coat the bottom of a 12-inch ovensafe skillet or an equivalent roasting pan with oil, just to keep the cabbage from sticking before juices trickle down.</li>
            <li>Arrange cabbage slices in the pan as if you were making a mosaic, cutting pieces down as needed to get them to fit itghtly.</li>
            <li>Season cabbage with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Pat your chicken dry and rub or brush it with 1 tablespoon of the butter. </li>
            <li>Generously salt and pepper the chicken all over (I use a full tablespoon of Diamond kosher salt on my 3-pound bird; use half of another brand).</li>
            <li>Place chicken breast side-up over the cabbage and roast for 45 to 60 minutes, spooning the bird and cabbage around it with butter a few times throughout.</li>
            <li>Chicken is done when a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast reads 155 degrees, or 165 degrees for the thigh.If your chicken is much larger and you find itâ€™s getting too dark for your tastes, reduce the heat to 425. </li>
            <li>Lift the chicken off the cabbage and set on a plate (or warmed tray) to rest.</li>
            <li>Flip each section of cabbage over carefully in the pan, nestling them back in, and return the pan to the oven for 5 to 10 minutes at 450 degrees, until the edges are very dark brown.</li>
            <li>Season with more salt and pepper if needed.</li>
            <li>Cut chicken into peices and serve with the cabbage, finishing everything with lemon if you wish</li>
        </ol>
